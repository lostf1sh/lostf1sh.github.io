# 2025 reflections

another year of code, mistakes, and small victories.

## what went well

finally shipped the personal website. it sat in drafts for 2 years. this year i stopped polishing and just released.

switched to zed full time. neovim config was a second job. not missing it.

started using chezmoi for dotfiles. should have done this 5 years ago.

## what did not

too many half-finished projects. the graveyard has 7 repos with 3 commits each.

 neglected the blog. 10 posts was the goal, hit 6. better than zero but not what i wanted.

## numbers

```
github contributions: 847
repos created: 12
repos deleted: 7
blog posts: 6
```

# 2026 goals

## writing

12 blog posts. one per month. topics: rust, devops, tooling, and fewer opinion pieces.

## code

ship 4 cli tools. small, focused, documented.

get comfortable with rust ownership. stop fighting the borrow checker.

## learning

go deeper on systems programming. currently surface level with too many languages.

## health

less screen time outside of work. the eyes notice.

# the plan

nothing revolutionary. just show up more consistently.

happy new year.
